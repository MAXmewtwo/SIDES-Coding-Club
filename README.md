> ### We completed our todo list for the day. Not bad for our first day!
> 
> > - [x] Install and Configure Git <https://git-scm.com/downloads>
> > - [x] Create SSH Keys (run `ssh-keygen` on the command line)
> > - [x] Create GitHub Account (if your reading this, you are done!)
> > - [x] Clone SIDES-Coding-Club (see below)
> > - [x] **Bonus** Install Visual Studio Code and the `Git Graph` extension <https://code.visualstudio.com>
>  
> For cloning the repository I recommend everyone use the SSH option. This allows easy syncronization between your local copies of the projects and the online GitHub copy. From your private fork page, ie github.com/your_name/SIDES-Coding-Club click on the `<> Code` tab and then use the `Code` drop down button like the screenshot below. Select SSH and copy the link. Then on your command line (terminal, git-bash, etc) cd to your code folder (`cd code`) and run `git clone git@github.com:your_name/SIDES-Coding-Club.git`. Windows and Linux users; you can optionally jump right into VSCode by running `code .` (yes that's a dot - it means "this folder"). Mac users open VSCode from the your desktop, select `open folder` and point it to you newly created `SIDES-Coding-Club` folder.

> *note: the screenshot of the terminal below uses the renixyyj/... repo. You need to change that to your private fork so that you can contribute your work back to the group*

> Thanks for participating in Coding Club today everyone. Overall I think it started well. I didn't realize until late that we actually finished the checklist so timing worked out. If anyone is having trouble with the install please put a question in the [discussion group](https://github.com/renixyyj/SIDES-Coding-Club/discussions).
